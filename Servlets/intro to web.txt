Introduction to Web
Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and 
wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. 

The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the 
response to the client. 

When a server answers a request, 
it usually sends some type of content to the client. 

The client uses web browser to send request to the server. 

The server often sends response to the browser with a set of 
instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). 

All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.

Web Application
A website is a collection of static files(webpages) such as HTML pages, 
images, graphics etc. 
A Web application is a web site with dynamic functionality on the server.
 Google, Facebook, Twitter are examples of web applications.
 
 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is a protocol that clients and servers use on the web to communicate.

It is similar to other internet protocols such as SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) 
and FTP(File Transfer Protocol) but there is one fundamental difference.

HTTP is a stateless protocol i.e HTTP supports only one request per connection. 
This means that with HTTP the clients connect to the server to send one request 
and then disconnects. This mechanism allows more users to connect to a given 
server over a period of time.

The client sends an HTTP request and the server answers with an HTML page 
to the client, using HTTP.
